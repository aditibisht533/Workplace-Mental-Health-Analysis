Predicting Workplace Mental Health Risks &amp; Treatment Seeking

• Built a predictive model using Logistic Regression to classify employees' likelihood of seeking mental
health treatment, initially achieving 68% precision, tested the random forest classification for improved
precision, but it remained at 65%. Applied feature importance analysis and dropped low-impact
features, yet accuracy stayed at 65%.

• Developed the Mental Health Support Index (MHSI), a custom scoring system designed to measure how
supportive a workplace is toward mental health based on survey responses and workplace policies.
Additionally, compared mental health support scores across industries to evaluate whether tech
companies provide better support than non-tech industries.

• Executed a robust data preprocessing pipeline, addressing missing values, optimizing categorical
encoding strategies, and standardizing numerical features to enhance model performance and reliability,
and conducted comprehensive EDA & Statistical Analysis to identify key workplace factors affecting
mental health challenges.

• Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction, enhancing K-Means Clustering to segment employees into
high, medium, and low-risk groups. Used scatter plots to illustrate cluster separation and identify
overlaps, revealing shared risk traits among employees. Analyzed treatment-seeking trends across
clusters using stacked bar charts, highlighting workplace mental health gaps.
